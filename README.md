Undergraduate Final Year Project

Kinect Motion Sensing & Capture Dancing Game with Ogre3D

It captures motion using Kinect sensor and stores the motion
in a hierarchical structure file, so that users can replay
the motion with this file and learn how to dance.

It also attempted a marking scheme to evaluate how well the
users dance, comparing to the original motion stored in the
file.
